## Science in Classics（经典中的科学）

**Course description:**

This course is an intellectual pursuit across various natural sciences including the two most fundamental ones, physical and biological sciences. Ancient Greek philosophers took the lead in exploring the physical world and the world of life with reason and hence laid the foundations of natural science. This human enquiry into Nature leads to a reflection on the human understanding of Nature and the humans’ place in Nature.

From the writings and stories of great scientists selected from influential literatures, students can gain a general understanding of the concepts and methodology of science, and of how scientists relate their academic pursuit to contemporary life, thereby developing their own perspectives on scientific issues. Students will be required to read, discuss and write about a wide range of texts in philosophy and science. Emphasis will be placed on students’ capacity to respond critically to these texts in written as well as oral presentations. Through these learning activities, students are expected to develop a lifelong capacity and enthusiasm to continue such dialogues with science texts in the future.

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

1. comprehend and discuss science-related texts;
2. identify the essential characteristics of how human beings view Nature;
3. identify various societal implications of scientific explorations;
4. relate the developments in natural sciences highlighted in the course to contemporary human condition; and
5. evaluate the scopes of application, achievement and limitations of highlighted scientific methods using multiple perspectives.
